    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <h2>This is a test</h2>
    <br>Why US?</br>
    <span>The U.S. has many important founding fathers and contributors to multiple technologies. The country gave birth to modern-day products like the touchscreen in Apple, the internet in Google, and the artificial intelligence (AI) in OpenAI. In the past, it also contributed to the industry with the invention of the plane by the Wright brothers, the television by Philo Farnsworth, and the phone by Graham Bell. Each of these products is a turning point in the era it was invented. The turning point, however, is only sometimes fully beneficial to the community. Not to mention, Americans are also a very complex group of people. They vary in age, height, gender, race, and opinion. If any changes happened to them, it would most likely happen to other cultures. Thus, America is considerably the best country to put into observation.</span>
